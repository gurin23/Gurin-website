    <h1 style="color: gold;">Understanding Government</h1>
    <p>
      The word <strong>"government"</strong> often feels distant to the average citizen. But in reality, government is not a building in Abuja or just a group of elected officials — it is the system that decides how we live, what we eat, how safe we are, and how free we can be. It is the invisible engine of a nation. Whether in democracy, monarchy, dictatorship, theocracy, or tribal systems, government shapes every detail of life. Understanding government is the first step toward responsible citizenship.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 Types of Governments Around the World</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Democracy:</strong> Rule by the people. Citizens vote for leaders and laws. Example: United States, Ghana, India.</li>
      <li><strong>Monarchy:</strong> Rule by kings or queens. Some have absolute power, others symbolic. Example: Saudi Arabia, UK.</li>
      <li><strong>Dictatorship:</strong> Rule by one powerful leader, often through fear. Example: North Korea, 1970s Uganda.</li>
      <li><strong>Theocracy:</strong> Rule by religious leaders using holy texts. Example: Iran, Vatican City.</li>
      <li><strong>Military Rule:</strong> When soldiers take control, usually after a coup. Example: Sudan, Nigeria (1966–1999).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🇳🇬 Nigeria’s Government: What You Must Know</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria is a <strong>federal democratic republic</strong> with 3 tiers: Federal, State, and Local. Each tier has 3 arms: the Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. These are designed to ensure that no person or group has total control. But do they work properly today? That’s the real question.
    </p>

    <h3>🏛 The Executive Arm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Federal Level:</strong> The President is the Head of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He appoints ministers, controls agencies, signs laws, and represents Nigeria abroad.</li>
      <li><strong>State Level:</strong> Governors act as mini-presidents. They control state budgets, agencies, and development plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Level:</strong> Chairmen of Local Government Areas manage grassroots development like primary schools, roads, and health centers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📝 The Legislative Arm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National Assembly:</strong> Includes the Senate (109) and House of Representatives (360). They make laws, approve budgets, and check the President.</li>
      <li><strong>State Houses of Assembly:</strong> Make laws for states and check the governors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚖️ The Judiciary Arm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interprets laws and settles disputes</li>
      <li>Includes Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, Federal High Courts, Sharia Courts, Customary Courts</li>
      <li>Should be independent — but often suffers from political interference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕌 Government in Islam & African Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      In Islam, leadership is an <strong>Amanah</strong> — a sacred trust. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that every leader is responsible for his people. Islamic leadership is based on justice (adl), consultation (shura), and accountability (hisab). Africa’s traditional systems also relied on elders, councils, and communal consensus — not dictatorship.
    </p>

    <h2>🏢 Ministries & Agencies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Federal Ministries:</strong> Education, Health, Defence, Agriculture, Finance, Youth, Justice, Environment, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Agencies:</strong> EFCC, ICPC, INEC, FRSC, NYSC, NAFDAC, etc.</li>
      <li>Each ministry or agency has a permanent secretary (civil servant) and a minister (politician). Many are corrupt or inefficient — that’s why we must demand transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📢 What Are Our Real Problems?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Corruption: Officials steal public funds openly</li>
      <li>Weak Institutions: Agencies that can’t do their jobs</li>
      <li>Poor Voter Education: People don’t know their rights or how leaders are elected</li>
      <li>Ethnic Politics: Voting based on tribe, not merit</li>
      <li>Suppressed Youth: Talented youth are sidelined by old, rich elites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✊🏽 Your Role in Government</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know your rights</strong> — read the Constitution</li>
      <li><strong>Register to vote</strong> and hold leaders accountable</li>
      <li><strong>Attend community meetings</strong> and ask questions</li>
      <li><strong>Protest peacefully</strong> when your voice is ignored</li>
      <li><strong>Think independently</strong> — don’t follow political lies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Message from Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin</h2>
    <p>
      I created this website because I saw that many of us are angry — but not informed. We complain, but don’t read. We blame leaders but don’t even know how government works. My dream is to change that. This platform is for every school, every teacher, every activist, every mosque and church that wants to educate citizens, not just graduate them. Join me in spreading the truth. 🇳🇬
