    <h1 style="color: gold;">Your Rights as a Human and a Citizen</h1>

    <p>
      Every human being is born with certain rights — not given by any man, president, king, or constitution. They are God-given. They come from your humanity, your soul, your existence. Whether you are rich or poor, Hausa or Igbo, Muslim or Christian, male or female — your rights are yours. This section of Gurin for Nigeria is created to teach you your rights. Because when you know your rights, you become powerful. And when a nation’s youth become powerful, oppression trembles.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 What Are Human Rights?</h2>
    <p>
      Human rights are the freedoms and protections every person is entitled to, simply because they are human. After World War II, the United Nations wrote the <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</strong> in 1948. It includes rights like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to life, liberty, and security</li>
      <li>Freedom of speech and religion</li>
      <li>Right to education, food, and shelter</li>
      <li>Right to work and earn a fair wage</li>
      <li>Freedom from slavery, torture, or discrimination</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕌 Islam and Human Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Long before the UN, Islam had already guaranteed rights through the Qur’an and the Sunnah. At the Farewell Sermon, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) declared:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “O people, your blood, your property, and your honour are sacred and inviolable.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Islam:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every soul is equal before Allah (Qur’an 49:13)</li>
      <li>Women have rights to education, inheritance, and dignity</li>
      <li>Slavery is abolished, and justice is a duty</li>
      <li>The weak and poor must be protected</li>
      <li>Even non-Muslims in a Muslim land have rights and protections</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🇳🇬 Rights Under the Nigerian Constitution</h2>
    <p>
      The Nigerian Constitution, under Chapter IV (Sections 33–46), lists the fundamental rights of every citizen. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Life</strong> – No one shall be killed unlawfully</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Dignity</strong> – No torture, inhuman or degrading treatment</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Personal Liberty</strong> – You must not be arrested or detained illegally</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Fair Hearing</strong> – You have the right to defend yourself in court</li>
      <li><strong>Freedom of Thought, Conscience, and Religion</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong> – You can speak, write, protest peacefully</li>
      <li><strong>Freedom of Assembly and Association</strong> – Join unions, parties, or groups</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Move Freely</strong> in Nigeria</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Own Property</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Freedom from Discrimination</strong> – based on ethnicity, gender, or religion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚠️ Are These Rights Respected?</h2>
    <p>
      Sadly, in Nigeria today, many of these rights are only written on paper. In reality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>People are detained for years without trial</li>
      <li>Peaceful protesters are shot or arrested (e.g., EndSARS)</li>
      <li>Police abuse, extortion, and brutality continue daily</li>
      <li>Journalists are kidnapped or harassed for reporting the truth</li>
      <li>Poor people are denied justice because they can’t pay lawyers</li>
      <li>Religious and ethnic minorities are attacked without protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✊🏽 How to Protect and Defend Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know the Law</strong>: Study your Constitution and Islamic teachings</li>
      <li><strong>Document Injustice</strong>: Use phones, videos, and writing</li>
      <li><strong>Speak Up</strong>: Raise awareness on social media and in communities</li>
      <li><strong>Join Movements</strong>: Work with legal and human rights groups</li>
      <li><strong>Take Legal Action</strong>: Sue or petition through courts or legal aid</li>
      <li><strong>Educate Others</strong>: Run clubs, campaigns, and youth groups</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📢 The Role of Government</h2>
    <p>
      The Nigerian government is supposed to protect these rights — not violate them. The police, military, and courts are funded by the people. When they fail, the people must respond — through education, resistance, law, and protest.
    </p>

    <h2>💥 Youth Power</h2>
    <p>
      Young people must be the front line in defending rights. Our future depends on what we allow today. If we stay silent now, we will suffer later. Political education is not just a topic — it is a weapon.
