    <h1 style="color: gold; text-align: center;">Welcome to Gurin for Nigeria</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
      Welcome to <strong>Gurin for Nigeria</strong> — a political education platform built by a young leader for the rise of a new Nigeria. This project is not just a website; it is a movement of thought, education, and transformation. I, <strong>Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin</strong>, created this to enlighten my generation and remind Africa of its strength, its history, and its future.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
      For too long, our people have been used — not empowered. Our voices have been silenced — not amplified. Our resources have been stolen — not shared. But now, we must rise. We must read, think, and speak. We must know our government, defend our rights, vote wisely, and lead boldly. From every village in Nigeria to the cities of the world, this is our time.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 A Platform for Truth and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Gurin for Nigeria</strong> is more than political news. It is a place where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students learn what they were never taught about Nigeria and Africa</li>
      <li>Citizens understand how their government works — and when it fails</li>
      <li>Rights are explained, elections are broken down, and power is given to the people</li>
      <li>Great African leaders are remembered, studied, and celebrated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📚 The Problem with Our Education</h2>
    <p>
      Many Nigerian schools teach obedience — not freedom. They teach dates — not change. They teach what to memorize — not how to lead. Our political system survives because people do not understand it. This website brings that knowledge back to the people. It is free. It is local. It is revolutionary.
    </p>

    <h2>🇳🇬 What Nigeria Must Become</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria must become a land where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaders serve, not steal</li>
      <li>Children are taught their rights from age 5</li>
      <li>Votes are counted and respected</li>
      <li>Youths are involved in law, media, and decision-making</li>
      <li>Religion is used for justice, not division</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We are not there yet. But we can build it — by first educating ourselves.
    </p>

    <h2>🌟 For the Youth of Africa</h2>
    <p>
      This movement starts with the youth. If you're 14 or 40, this site is for you. We must stop waiting for the government. We must become the government. Start by reading. Start by speaking. Start by questioning every lie you were told in the name of politics.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “You can cage the body of a man — but not his mind. Once the youth understand their rights, no dictator can last.” — Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🔊 Message to the Government</h2>

      We are not disrespecting the government. We are demanding better. We are not insulting leaders — we are reminding them of their duty. This project is peaceful but powerful. It is legal. It is Islamic. It is African.
