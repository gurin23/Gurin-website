    <h1 style="color: gold;">Elections: The People's Power</h1>

    <p>
      Elections are not just about politicians. They are about you. They are about the future of your family, your education, your job, your peace, and your freedom. When citizens vote with wisdom, they choose their destiny. But when they vote with ignorance, money, or tribal hatred, they choose their downfall. This section is a full guide to understanding elections — globally, in Nigeria, and through Islamic principles.
    </p>

    <h2>🗳️ What Is an Election?</h2>
    <p>
      An election is a formal process where people choose leaders through voting. In strong democracies, elections are free, fair, and transparent. In weak systems, elections are manipulated, rigged, or meaningless. Real elections give power to the people. Fake ones steal that power back.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 Types of Elections Around the World</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Presidential System:</strong> Voters elect a president who leads the government. Example: Nigeria, USA.</li>
      <li><strong>Parliamentary System:</strong> Voters elect lawmakers; lawmakers choose the prime minister. Example: UK, India.</li>
      <li><strong>Single-Round:</strong> Whoever has the highest votes wins (even if not majority).</li>
      <li><strong>Two-Round System:</strong> If no one gets 50%, a second round is held. Nigeria uses this for presidential elections.</li>
      <li><strong>Proportional Representation:</strong> Seats are shared based on party percentage. Example: South Africa.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🇳🇬 Nigeria’s Electoral System</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria holds elections every 4 years. Citizens elect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>President</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Governors</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Senators and House of Reps Members</strong></li>
      <li><strong>State Assembly Members</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Local Government Chairmen and Councilors</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The process is controlled by the <strong>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</strong>. INEC registers voters, conducts elections, announces results, and handles disputes.
    </p>

    <h2>⚠️ The Reality: Problems with Nigerian Elections</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vote Buying:</strong> Politicians bribe voters with money, food, or clothes</li>
      <li><strong>Violence:</strong> Political thugs attack opponents or snatch ballot boxes</li>
      <li><strong>Tribal and Religious Politics:</strong> Votes are cast based on ethnicity or religion, not competence</li>
      <li><strong>INEC’s Failures:</strong> Delays, rigging, and poor results transmission</li>
      <li><strong>Low Turnout:</strong> Many citizens don’t vote because they’ve lost trust</li>
      <li><strong>Fake Results:</strong> Inflation of votes and announcement of wrong winners</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📢 The Role of INEC</h2>
    <p>
      INEC is meant to be independent — but it is often influenced by political powers. It must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct voter education</li>
      <li>Use reliable technology (like BVAS machines)</li>
      <li>Train and protect election staff</li>
      <li>Announce results transparently and on time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕌 Islam and the Concept of Leadership Election</h2>
    <p>
      In Islam, leadership is a responsibility and a trust. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: <em>“Each of you is a shepherd, and each of you is responsible for his flock.”</em> Leaders must be chosen for their honesty, wisdom, and fear of Allah — not for wealth, tribe, or name.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shura (Consultation):</strong> Decisions should be made through collective agreement and advice</li>
      <li><strong>Amanah (Trust):</strong> Leadership must benefit the people, not the leader</li>
      <li><strong>Adl (Justice):</strong> A leader must never oppress, lie, or cheat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📉 Why Our Elections Fail</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> People sell their vote to survive one day</li>
      <li><strong>Illiteracy:</strong> Voters don’t understand the issues or the candidates</li>
      <li><strong>Youth Apathy:</strong> Young people don’t register or vote</li>
      <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> Even judges and INEC officers may be bribed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔥 The Solution: Youth Political Education</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Educate others on how elections work</li>
      <li>Join campaigns for free and fair elections</li>
      <li>Register to vote and vote with wisdom</li>
      <li>Report electoral fraud through legal means</li>
      <li>Don’t let tribalism or religion control your decision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📅 What Happens After Elections?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Winners must be held accountable</li>
      <li>Court cases can challenge results if necessary</li>
      <li>Citizens must continue engaging — not sleep until 4 years later</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Message from Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin</h2>
    <p>
      If we continue to vote for people who do not care about us, we will remain poor, divided, and hopeless. But if we vote for leaders of vision, truth, and humility, we will rise again as a nation. My dream is a Nigeria where no one can win an election by bribe, lie, or bullet. Only the truth should win. Let’s build it — together.
