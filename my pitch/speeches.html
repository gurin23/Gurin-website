    <h1 style="color: gold;">Revolutionary Speeches That Changed Africa</h1>

    <p>
      Words are not just sounds — they are weapons. A powerful speech can break chains, awaken minds, and start revolutions. In Africa, great leaders didn’t just fight with guns — they fought with truth. Their speeches were fire against fear, knowledge against ignorance, and courage against colonialism. This section is a collection of those timeless words — and new ones from today’s dreamers like me, Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin.
    </p>

    <h2>🗣️ Thomas Sankara – “The Enemies of the People”</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “We must dare to invent the future. He who feeds you, controls you.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Thomas Sankara's speeches in Burkina Faso were electric. He spoke directly to the poor, the youth, and the women. He exposed how France, corporations, and local elites were sucking African wealth. His speeches sparked farmers, teachers, and students to rise up.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 Kwame Nkrumah – “Africa Must Unite”</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “The independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is linked up with the total liberation of Africa.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Nkrumah didn’t just want Ghana to be free — he wanted a United States of Africa. His speeches called for one passport, one currency, one military, and one voice for all Black people. He inspired the OAU and generations of Pan-Africanists.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 Muammar Gaddafi – “I Am Not a President”</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “I am not a president. I do not govern. I guide the revolution. I serve the people.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Gaddafi’s speeches at the African Union were bold. He said the West sees Africa as a farm to be harvested. He proposed one African army, one gold-backed currency, and one voice for Africa. Some called him mad — others called him the last lion.
    </p>

    <h2>🕊️ Patrice Lumumba – Congo Independence Speech</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “The Congo's independence is not a gift. It is a struggle won by blood, pain, and tears.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In 1960, while others were thanking Belgium, Lumumba stood and exposed colonial crimes. His speech shook the world. Weeks later, he was assassinated. His words, however, still haunt and inspire Africa’s conscience.
    </p>

    <h2>💥 From the Youth: Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Nigeria will rise when truth becomes stronger than tribe, when education replaces violence, when youth stop waiting for permission to lead.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I am not yet a president. I am not yet a senator. But I am a Nigerian who loves his people. I speak because silence is no longer an option. My generation will no longer be used as political tools. We will not be slaves of money, tribe, or fear. We will rise with books, with unity, with wisdom, and with fire in our hearts.
    </p>

    <h2>📚 Lessons from Great African Speeches</h2>

      <li><strong>Inspire Action:</strong> Words should move people, not just impress them</li>

    </ul>

    <h1 style="color: gold;">Great African Leaders</h1>

    <p>
      Africa has produced some of the boldest, wisest, and most fearless leaders the world has ever seen. These men didn’t just lead — they fought against colonizers, poverty, injustice, and corruption. They didn’t seek power for luxury; they sought it for the freedom and dignity of their people. This section is a tribute, a political education, and a challenge to the youth of Africa: <strong>study these leaders — and become better than them.</strong>

    <h2>🦁 Muammar Gaddafi – The King of Kings of Africa</h2>
    <img src="images/gaddafi.png" alt="Muammar Gaddafi" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border: 3px solid gold; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Muammar Gaddafi was born in 1942 in the Libyan desert to Bedouin parents. As a young man, he studied military science and became inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser’s Arab nationalism. At the age of 27, he led a bloodless coup that overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969.
    </p>

    <h3>Ideology: Islamic Socialism</h3>
    <p>
      Gaddafi introduced a unique ideology called the “Third Universal Theory,” which he wrote in his <em>Green Book</em>. It combined Islamic values, socialism, and direct democracy. He rejected both capitalism and communism, claiming neither respected the people’s voice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He banned political parties, replacing them with “People’s Congresses”</li>
      <li>Oil wealth was distributed directly to Libyan citizens</li>
      <li>He rejected foreign control, demanding full sovereignty for Libya</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transformed Libya into one of Africa’s richest countries (before sanctions)</li>
      <li>Provided free housing, free education, and healthcare for all Libyans</li>
      <li>Built the Great Man-Made River — the world’s largest irrigation project</li>
      <li>Invested billions in African banks, satellites, and liberation movements</li>
      <li>Dreamed of a United States of Africa — with one army, one passport, and one currency backed by gold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pan-Africanism</h3>
    <p>
      Gaddafi declared himself a warrior for Africa. He called for unity among African nations and proposed an African Union stronger than today’s AU. He said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Africa is not poor. Africa is rich in resources. It is our leaders who make us poor.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Controversies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Critics said his system was authoritarian and anti-democratic</li>
      <li>He was accused of supporting militias and rebels in other countries</li>
      <li>Western governments saw him as a threat to their global power</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
    <p>
      In 2011, during the Arab Spring, NATO and Libyan rebels overthrew Gaddafi. He was captured and killed brutally. But many Africans believe his murder was not a liberation — it was a punishment for challenging the West.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “I am not a king. I do not rule. I guide the revolution.” — Gaddafi
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Today, Libya is unstable, divided, and poorer than before. Many Africans still wear Gaddafi’s image on their shirts, still read his speeches, and still believe in the dream of a strong, united, free Africa.

    <h1 style="color: gold;">Thomas Sankara – The Upright Man</h1>

    <img src="images/sankara.png" alt="Thomas Sankara" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border: 3px solid gold; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Thomas Sankara was born in 1949 in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso). He grew up under French colonial rule and joined the military early, where he gained leadership and ideological training. He was heavily inspired by Marxism, Pan-Africanism, and liberation theology.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1983, Sankara led a peaceful revolution and became the President at the age of 33. Within just four years, he transformed the political, economic, and social landscape of his country.
    </p>

    <h3>Vision and Ideology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anti-Imperialism:</strong> Rejected foreign aid and IMF control</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Reliance:</strong> Made Burkina Faso produce its own food and clothes</li>
      <li><strong>Feminism:</strong> Appointed women to high positions and outlawed forced marriage</li>
      <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Sankara refused luxury. He sold the presidential fleet, rode a bicycle, and reduced salaries of officials</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “We must dare to invent the future.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Major Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Renamed the country from “Upper Volta” to <strong>Burkina Faso</strong> — “Land of Upright People”</li>

      <li>Planted over 10 million trees to stop desertification</li>
      <li>Built schools, roads, hospitals, and houses using local resources</li>
      <li>Nationalized land and natural resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Famous Speeches</h3>
    <p>
      Sankara’s speeches at the United Nations, African Union, and in his home country were full of wisdom, challenge, and truth:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Debt is a cleverly managed reconquest of Africa… We cannot repay the debt. We should not repay the debt.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      “The revolution cannot triumph without the liberation of women.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
    <p>
      On October 15, 1987, Thomas Sankara was assassinated in a coup organized by his close friend Blaise Compaoré, with support from foreign actors. He was only 37 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sankara lives forever in the hearts of Africans who believe in truth, discipline, justice, and dignity. Statues, books, and songs have been made in his name. His image is on walls in Dakar, Abuja, Harare, and even Paris.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas.” — Thomas Sankara

<section id="nkrumah" style="padding: 60px 20px; background-color: #ffff;">
  <div class="overlay">
    <h1 style="color: gold;">Kwame Nkrumah – Father of African Independence</h1>

    <img src="images/ nkrumah-.png" alt="Kwame Nkrumah" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border: 3px solid gold; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Kwame Nkrumah was born in 1909 in Nkroful, Gold Coast (now Ghana). He studied in the United States and later in London, where he became politically active and inspired by Black liberation thinkers like Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Du Bois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nkrumah returned home to lead Ghana to become the <strong>first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence</strong> from colonial rule — in 1957. His words at the celebration rang across Africa:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “At long last, the battle has ended! And thus, Ghana — your beloved country — is free forever!”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Vision and Ideology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pan-Africanism:</strong> Nkrumah believed Africa must unite politically and economically</li>
      <li><strong>Industrialization:</strong> He wanted to turn Ghana into a modern economy</li>
      <li><strong>Socialism:</strong> Advocated state ownership of key industries to benefit all</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-Imperialism:</strong> Opposed colonialism, neocolonialism, and foreign exploitation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Built <strong>Akosombo Dam</strong> — one of Africa’s biggest hydroelectric power projects</li>
      <li>Founded schools, universities, and research centers</li>
      <li>Launched industrial factories and transportation systems</li>
      <li>Hosted the first Pan-African Conference in Africa in 1958</li>
      <li>Wrote important books like <em>“Africa Must Unite”</em> and <em>“Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism”</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pan-African Struggle</h3>
    <p>
      Nkrumah used Ghana’s freedom as a weapon for others’ liberation. He supported freedom fighters from Algeria to Zimbabwe and from Congo to Angola. He believed Africa needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One African Army</li>
      <li>One African Currency</li>
      <li>One African Government</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      “The independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is linked to the total liberation of Africa.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Challenges and Overthrow</h3>
    <p>
      Some Ghanaians felt Nkrumah was becoming too powerful and repressive. His enemies accused him of centralizing power and wasting money. In 1966, while on a peace mission to Vietnam, his government was overthrown in a CIA-backed military coup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nkrumah died in exile in Guinea in 1972 — betrayed by the same powers he tried to fight. But his vision lives on in the African Union, in the call for unity, and in every young person who dreams of African greatness.
    </p>

    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Honored as one of the greatest Africans of all time</li>
      <li>Inspired dozens of movements for unity, education, and sovereignty</li>
      <li>Statues, books, and schools named after him across the continent</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Born in 1920 in Kano, Nigeria, Mallam Aminu Kano grew up under both Islamic and Western education. He became a teacher, an Islamic scholar, and then a political activist who never feared the powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1940s, he started challenging the northern aristocracy and colonial rule. He formed the **Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU)** — the first major political party in Northern Nigeria to speak for the <strong>talakawa</strong> (common people).
    </p>

    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “A society that denies education to women is like a bird trying to fly with one wing.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Political Journey</h3>
    <p>
      Aminu Kano was constantly arrested, threatened, and mocked by the elite, but he never stopped. He later formed the **People’s Redemption Party (PRP)** and continued to speak for the voiceless during Nigeria’s early republics and military regimes.
    </p>

      <li>Served in government but never abandoned his simplicity</li>

    <h1 style="color: gold; text-align: center;">🗣️ My Speech: A Call for African Greatness</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.9;">
      I am <strong>Muhammad Ibrahim Gurin</strong>. I am a Nigerian. I am young. But I am not silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      I come from a continent that gave birth to kings before Europe knew the alphabet. I come from a people whose gold, oil, and knowledge built the modern world. And I come from a country, Nigeria, where the poor are still waiting for the promises written on our flag.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page is not just about the past. It is about the future. It is about me. It is about you. It is about every African boy and girl who refuses to be invisible. I created this website because I believe that political education must be strong, deep, and loud. We have been kept ignorant for too long. The leaders on this page — Sankara, Gaddafi, Nkrumah, Aminu Kano — they were not perfect, but they were bold. They dared to dream. Now it is our turn.
    </p>

    <blockquote style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; color: #f0e68c; border-left: 5px solid gold; padding-left: 15px;">
      "My generation must not be remembered for TikTok dances and silence. We must be remembered for awakening. For rising. For rebuilding this continent."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I do not write this for likes or fame. I write this because I know what poverty tastes like. I know how it feels when politicians steal what belongs to children. I know the weight of being young and being ignored. But I also know that Africa will rise — not from America, not from Europe — but from here. From the ground. From the classrooms. From the slums. From the mosques and churches. From our dreams.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, I want to stand before the people and say:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; color: #f0e68c; border-left: 5px solid gold; padding-left: 15px;">
